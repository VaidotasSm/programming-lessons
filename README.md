# Programming Lessons
Structured lessons for various subjects of programming. Targeted for beginners and hopefully up.

Goals:
* Strive for immediate productivity in incremental steps - each step improves on knowledge, but should be sufficient for doing something immediately. 
* Minimalistic - no long descriptions, fewer words the better. Should serve as quick reference later on.
